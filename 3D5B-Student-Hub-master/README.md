# Student Hub
A TCD Student App developed in CSU33D06 Software Design Analysis by Group 1. 

Students are able to register, login, select modules, find grade analytics, reviews, download or upload corse material, record deadline reminders and their attendance records. 

The app is developed with Android Studio using Java, Firebase is used for backend hosting and Github is used for code sharing and management. Group members have their own branch, and the changes are merged to master by opening pull requests.

The app's layout looks best on a Pixel 2 XL emulator.
